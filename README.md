<h1>☀️🌥 Weather App </h1>

This was a _nology project where I used the weather-api along with ReactTs to create an web application that can show the local weather depending on the user's location. If the user has their location settings off the results will show the local weather defaulted to London. I also added a sticky note to do list feature so that you can update your daily important tasks.

<h2>✍️What you can do:</h2>
<ul>🟢 Show local weather info for the day and the rest of the week</ul>
<ul>🟢 Make a to do list for your important daily tasks</ul>

<h2>💻 Technologies used:</h2>
<ul>🔵React</ul>
<ul>🔵Typescript / Javascript</ul>

<h2>🧩 Components</h2>
<br>The project is structured with the following components:
<br><br>
<uL><b>App:</b>The root component that acts as the main of the app</uL>
<uL><b>Greeting:</b> The navigation bar that shows a greeting message which changes depending on the time of day.</uL>
<uL><b>DayCard:</b> A reusable card component which shows the weather for the day</uL>
<uL><b>DayCardList:</b> Renders the DayCard into a list of cards to show the weather.</uL>
<uL><b>WeatherCard:</b> The component that acts as the homepage of the card and pulls together all of the components into one page.</uL>
<uL><b>WeekCardList:</b> Reuses the DayCard to display a WeekCardList which shows the weather forecase for the rest of the week.</uL>
<uL><b>ToDoList:</b> A component for the user to write a to do list of the day where they can check it off and delete it once its done, or reset the whole list.</uL>
<uL><b>TaskItem:</b> a sub-component for the to do list that enables a task to be added.</uL>
